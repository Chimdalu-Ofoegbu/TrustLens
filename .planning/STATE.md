# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Any human or agent can get a deterministic, evidence-based answer to "should I hire this OKX.AI agent?" in one paid MCP call.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Data Indexer

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 coarse phases; timeboxed scraper (INDX-04) merged into final hardening phase — sequenced after the money path, CSV fallback is designed behavior, not failure
- [Roadmap]: Ops distributed, not deferred — Dockerfile/compose/.env.example land with Phase 3 (server), README registration section finalized in Phase 5 after the Phase 4 curl check is rehearsable
- [Pre-build]: x402 v2 implemented natively + `X402_MOCK` verifier; `okxweb3-app-x402` documented as deploy-time drop-in (SDK needs wallet-tied OKX creds = human stop condition)
- [Pre-build]: Pin `fastmcp>=3,<4` — FastMCP is 3.x; v2-era tutorials and constructor kwargs are wrong

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Census CSV has NO category column, but `category_leaderboard` and the price-vs-category component require one — resolve source (detail-page scrape vs deterministic buckets, method disclosed on methodology page) before scoring is finalized
- [Phase 4]: Verify `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header encoding (base64 vs raw JSON) against OKX docs at build time; keep encoding a one-line switch and `FREE_METHODS` configurable
- [Deadline]: Submit for review July 10–11; up to 24h external review; live before July 17 23:59 UTC — deploy/registration/posting are human-only steps, so materials must be finished at least a day early

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Payments | PAYX-04: real on-chain settlement via `okxweb3-app-x402` facilitator | v2 (deploy-time, human-gated; integration seam + docs ship in v1) | 2026-07-10 |
| Data | INDX-05: scheduled recurring re-scrapes / longitudinal snapshots | v2 | 2026-07-10 |
